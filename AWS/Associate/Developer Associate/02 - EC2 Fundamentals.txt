Amazon EC2:

- EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS offering.
- EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS)
- It mainly consists in the capability of:
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2 Instances)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS volumes)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB - Elastic Load Balancer)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
- Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works.

EC2 Sizing & Configuration options [What options we can choose for our virtual instances/servers that we rent from AWS]:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
- How much compute power & cores (CPU)
- How much random-access memory (RAM)
- How much storage space:
	- Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	- hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
- Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data:
--------------
- It is possible to bootstrap our instances using EC2 User data script.
- bootstraping means launching commands when a machine starts.
- That script is only run once at the instance first start.
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	- Installing updates
	- Installing Software
